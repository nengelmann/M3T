### 3D Object Tracking

Tracking objects and kinematic structures in 3D space and determining their poses and configurations is an essential task in computer vision. Its application ranges from augmented reality to robotic perception. Given consecutive image frames, as well as 3D meshes and kinematic information, the goal is to robustly estimate the rotation and translation of all bodies relative to a camera. While the problem has been thoroughly studied, many challenges such as partial occlusions, appearance changes, motion blur, background clutter, object ambiguity, and real-time requirements still exist.
